              Diagnosing your Refrigeration Issue
            </h3>

            <p className="page__subtitle">
              Some refrigerators or freezers are easy to diagnose, and others
              are more difficult. Leaking water or a burnt-out bulb is easy to
              spot. But other situations may have a problem that is not quite as
              evident. This is where our years of experience benefit you and
              your appliances.
            </p>

            <p className="page__subtitle">
              Our trained technicians will carefully inspect your refrigerator
              and freezer and correctly diagnose the root of the issue. Then we
              can suggest repair options to you for your review and
              consideration. That is when the repair can begin.
